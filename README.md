# Linux-FilesBackup
currently on windows again, I want to go back to linux, when I do, I will put my files on my repo.

this is for my own personal use, however anyone can use my files, this will mostly consist of my configs for programs, or my window manager.

WARNING: ||||I USE COLEMAK|||| My workflow and keybinds will be funky because of this.

dont expect this to be updated regularly if you are working off of my files, for some reason, you can contact me at:
